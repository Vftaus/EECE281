EECE 281 GitHub Guidelines

--COMMIT EARLY AND OFTEN

--Please only work on your own blocks to prevent merge conflicts. If you need something changed contact the 
  block owner. since we will be working on the same file (most likely) it would be helpful if you signed 
  your work.

	example:

	;Eric Secules
	
		code
		code
		code
		.
		.
		.
		code

	;end Eric Secules


--Use GitHub to report bugs 

--Write meaningful commit statements

	example:
		git commit -m "fixed bug #4 and added SPI interface"

--commit the .asm files, github supports that.
